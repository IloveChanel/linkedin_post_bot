You're Wasting 10+ Hours a Week on Social Media.  ⏰😩

As a business owner, your time is worth $100-$500+ per hour. 

If you're spending 2 hours a day: 
→ Thinking of what to post
→ Creating graphics
→ Scheduling content
→ Responding to comments

That's 10 hours/week = $1,000-$5,000 in lost productivity. 

Hiring a social media manager costs $500-$1,500/month.
But it SAVES you $4,000-$20,000 in time value.

Plus, professionals know: 
✅ When to post for maximum engagement
✅ What content converts followers to customers
✅ How to use analytics to improve results

Stop doing $15/hour work when you should be doing $500/hour work.
