The $5,000 Website vs The $500 Template:  What's the Difference? 💰

Let me break it down:

$500 Template: 
❌ Looks like 10,000 other sites
❌ Slow and bloated
❌ Limited features
❌ You fix your own bugs
❌ No SEO optimization
❌ Generic = forgettable

$5,000 Custom Professional Site:
✅ 100% unique to YOUR brand
✅ Lightning fast performance
✅ Built for exactly what you need
✅ Professional support included
✅ SEO-optimized from day one
✅ Memorable = more conversions

You wouldn't hire a discount surgeon.  Why hire a discount web designer?

Your website is your 24/7 salesperson.  Invest in a professional.
